BFF - Project06
=========

Block-Food-Fest (BFF) is offering supermarkets the opportunity to save food which otherwise would be thrown away. 
Thanks to GLOCAL communities of foodies, people are able to see and taste how to transform about-to-be wasted food 
into something delicious!!!
Yum Yum Yum!!
